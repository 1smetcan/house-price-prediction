# house-price-prediction
In this project, I aim to predict house prices using various machine learning models. I will explore the dataset to understand the key features and relationships between variables, perform feature engineering, and build regression models to predict house prices. The dataset used in this project is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). An explanation of the dataset can be found in the attached document (Data Variables for Housing Predictions.docx).
